Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
While there are still numbers left in the list
    Look at the next number in the list
    Compare it to the maxNumber
        If next number is smaller than maxNumber
            Set maxNumber to that numb*er
Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list

The error in the code will be, If next number is smaller than maxNumber, Set maxNumber to that number; the if 
condition above will update maxNumber to the smallest number available instead of the biggest number available
